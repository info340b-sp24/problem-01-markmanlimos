<p>
Ash Ketchum is the main character of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PokÃ©mon"> Pokemon.</a>
Throughout the past 2 decades, he has strived to become the Pokemon champion of every region he has visited.
</p>
<ul>
Reasons I admire Ash:
<li>Even though he loses every time he challenges the champion, he continues to work to win in the next region</li>
<li class="color_line">He never takes the easy way out and often starts each region with weaker Pokemon than he ended the last region with</li>
<li>He has unwaivering determination in the face of adversity throughout the show</li>
</ul>
